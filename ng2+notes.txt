The different things we need to build angular2 application.

1.Download and install node
(node comes with tool npm)
2.I.D.E. or textEditor


package.json
-------------
application need library or modules for their functioning and these are specified in the package.json,
tsconfig.json
--------------
This file contains configuration of typescript compiler generating javascript files.
Since the browser can understand javascript only so the typescript file needs to be converted in javascript.
systemjs.config
---------------
This file deals with loading of module and default file extension.

index.html
-----------
1.Loading the libraries
2.Configure syste.js
3.Display the application(Use the root component's selector metadata property in the body tag to instantiate the root component class)





******
Use the CLI tool to quickly build Angular Application


We can start with angular in following high level steps with angular cli...
1.Set up the devlopment enviroment.
2.Create a new project and skeleton app.
3.Serve the application.
4.Edit the application.

1.Set up the devlopment enviroment.
-----------------------------------
Install node.js and npm (if doesn't hve installed)
If have installed then Verify that you are running at least node 6.9.x and npm 3.x.x by running node -v and npm -v in a terminal/console window. Older versions produce errors, but newer versions are fine.

Then install angular cli globally 
$npm install -g @angular/cli 

2.Create a new project
-----------------------
Run the below command to create a new project
$ng new <app-name>
3.Serve the application
------------------------
Go to the project directory and launch the server.
$cd app-name
$ng serve --open
The ng serve command launches the server,watches your files,and rebuilds the app as you make changes to any of the files.
